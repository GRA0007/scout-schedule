# Scout Schedule System
The scout schedule system is designed to display upcoming activities and camps for any scout group.
Currently, the SSS is in development.

This is a project by [Dirk](http://informathing.tk/) and [Ben](https://benpai.keybase.pub/).

This project has been deprecated in favour of the new [Scout project](https://github.com/ScoutProject). It will be one of the features available there.
